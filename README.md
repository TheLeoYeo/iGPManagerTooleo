# iGP Manager Tooleo
 An application designed to help with managing various aspects of accounts in the game iGP Manager.


## Requirements:
* Python 3.9 or higher to run the application
* Don't run it on a potato :)

## Running the application:
* If on windows:
    1. Go into the tools folder, double click winInitialiser.bat (it will install pipenv on your system)
    2. Then you should be able to start the app by double clicking winStart.bat

* If on linux (untested on mac but should work):
    1. Go into the tools folder, double click initialiser.sh (it will install pipenv on your system)
    2. Then you should be able to start the app by double clicking start.sh

## What can you do:
* Add/remove iGP accounts to log in to
* Choose certain tasks for these accounts to do which include:
    * Training drivers
    * Fixing engines and parts of cars
* The tasks will be added to a stack of jobs which the app will go through

## What it might do some day 100 years from now:
* Allow the user to setup their cars and set strategies
* Allow the user to run tasks in the background at regular intervals
* Allow the user to revisit or save jobs that haven't been completed
* Allow the user to have presets/save configurations of tasks and accounts, so they can do the same thing every time without much extra effort
